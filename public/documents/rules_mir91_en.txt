<h4>The Story</h4>
<p align="justify">This simulation is inspired by real events.<br />
You work in the ground control of the STS-91 space mission.
This mission took place in June 1998 as part of the Shuttle-Mir program (Phase One).
At that time, astronauts from various countries were at the station.
An important part of the mission was the docking of the Space Shuttle Discovery.
Ground control was divided into teams deployed in remote locations.

<h4>The Map</h4>
<p align="justify">Each room symbolizes one type of work to be done at the station, space shuttle and their surroundings.
A large map on the table is used to exchange information and coordinate activities.
Codes from the plates on the walls around are used to move around the virtual map.
Fields of the same color require similar skills.
Fields in open space require a space suit.

<h4>The App</h4>
<p align="justify">You perform all your actions in the simulation via smartphone.
The top bar shows the time <b> (1) </b>, your victory points <b> (5) </b> and the team.
The icon in the center of the screen <b> (6) </b> shows what room you are currently working on.
The number under the room number <b> (8) </b> shows how much work to do.
If this number drops to zero, we say that the room has been cleared.
Work is always done automatically. Speed ​​depends on your skills.
Your skills (SKILLS) shows a colored bar <b> (4) </b> in the room.
The red <b> (7) </b> button calls the keyboard to enter codes.
Entering the code starts the action.
The rooms may fail (ALERT) - you can see the <b> (2) crash icon </b>.
Astronauts <b> (3) </b> accelerate work.

<h4>The Goal</h4>
<p align="justify"> The goal is to get the highest number of victory points (VPs) or to fulfill scenario goal given by Game Master.
</p>

<h4>Teams</h4>
<p align="justify">Before the simulation, team leaders will receive team codes.
Team leaders will also receive task cards in accordance with the scenario being implemented.
Enter the team code to go to this team.
</p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
<p align="justify">Performing tasks gives the team victory points (VPs).
To perform a task, you must first activate it (by entering and confirming the task code).
After activating the task, additional work will be displayed in the rooms.
When all task rooms are cleared, the task is completed.
Each task can be activated only once per workshop.
</p>

<h4>Accidents</h4>
<p align="justify">The red symbol indicates an accident in the room.
Each accident increases the amount of work in the room over time.
Removal of a failure requires that you perform work in this room.
</p>

<h4>Moving</h4>
<p align="justify">To go to another room, enter the code from the plate on the wall or use a quick code.
The codes change during the simulation - remember to select the most current code.

<h4>Quick codes</h4>
<p align="justify">Quick codes marked on the keyboard allow you to call an astronaut, move to the next room, stop and show the information screen.
</p>

<h4>Astronauts</h4>
<p align="justify">There are 3 astronauts in the station, controlled by ground control.
Astronauts need space suits to work outside of the station.
In order for an astronaut to wear a suit, work must be done on the 34/35/36 rooms.
Each astronaut speeds up the work.
Everyone can call an astronaut with a quick code.

<h4>Punkty zwycięstwa (VP)</h4>
<p align="justify">There are two ways to score:</p>
<ul>
<li> Clearing the alert: +25 VP </li>
<li> And completing the task during the single sprint: +100 VP for each star </li>
</ul>
<p align = "justify"> Points are split when the event occurs.
Points are divided equally for all team members.
Points for completing the task go to the team that started this task.

<h4>Skills</h4>
<p align="justify">Skills shows your work speed in a room.
You can see your skills on the navigation bar and on the information screen.
Everyone develops their own skills.
When you are in a room, your skills in this room and rooms of the same color grow slowly and fall slowly on the rooms in other colors.
</p>

<h4>How to play</h4>
<p align="justify">Join one of the teams. <br />
Select and activate the task. <br />
Do the work in task rooms to get points. <br />
Remove alerts to get points. <br />
Call astronauts to work faster.
